# Getting Started

The UK Address Lookup documentation is a collection of guides and resources to help you get the most out of the 
UK Address Lookup API. We designed the API to be easy to use with a low barrier to entry, coupled with our affordable
pricing model, we hope to make it as easy as possible for you to get started.

To get started with the UK Address Lookup API, you will need to sign up for an account and set up an application.

When you sign up, you are given 50 free tokens to use to get started. You can use these tokens to test the API and see
how it works. Once you have used up your free tokens, you can purchase more from the dashboard.

## Tokens

Tokens can be purchased from the dashboard in bundles of 500, 2000, 5000, and 12000. The more tokens you buy, the 
cheaper the unit price of the token. Tokens are used to make requests to the API. Most requests cost a single token,
however some like the address autocomplete use only 0.1 tokens. New additional services will be added in the future
which will consume different amounts of tokens.

|Service|Token Cost|
|---|---|
|Address Lookup|1|
|Address Autocomplete|0.1|
|Postcode Lookup|1|

## Rate Limits

The UK Address Lookup API has a rate limit of 10 requests per second. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a
429 Too Many Requests response. If you need to make more requests, you can increase your rate limit by contacting
support.
