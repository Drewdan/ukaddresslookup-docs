# Dashboard

The dashboard will provide you with an overview of your account, including recent usage, transactions, and some 
useful stats to help you monitor your usage.

## Topping Up

You can top up your tokens from the dashboard. Tokens can be purchased in bundles of 500, 2000, 5000, and 12000. The more
tokens you buy, the cheaper the unit price of the token.

## Development Roadmap

We are constantly working on new features and improvements for UK Address Lookup. Most notably, we are working on
the following features:

- Auto-renewing tokens - set alerts and thresholds to automatically top up your tokens or send an alert when you are running low.
- Application specific tokens - generate tokens that are only valid for a specific application.

If there are any features you would like to see, please get in touch with us
